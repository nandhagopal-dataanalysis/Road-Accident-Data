# Road-Accident-Data
The "Road Accident Data" project is dedicated to a comprehensive analysis of traffic incidents to uncover critical insights that can enhance road safety measures. By examining various factors contributing to accidents, this project aims to identify patterns and propose data-driven recommendations for accident prevention.

# Project Objectives:

* Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough examination of road accident data to identify key factors such as location, time, weather conditions, road types, and severity levels.

* Pattern Recognition: Utilize statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to detect trends and correlations within the data, aiming to understand the underlying causes of accidents.

* Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict accident occurrence and severity, assisting in proactive safety measures and resource allocation.

* Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to present findings in an accessible manner, facilitating informed decision-making for stakeholders.

# Data Source:

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset encompassing detailed records of road accidents, including variables such as date, time, location, weather conditions, road characteristics, involved vehicles, and casualty information. This dataset provides a robust foundation for in-depth analysis and modeling.

# KPI's Requirement :

Clients want to create a Road Accident Dashboard for years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements.

* Primary KPI - Total Casualties taken place after the accident

*	Primary KPI'S - Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum Casualties by the type of vehicle

*	Secondary KPI'S - Total Casualties with Respect to vehicle type

*	Monthly trend showing comparison of Casualties for current year and previous year

*	Maximum Casualties by Road type

*	Distribution of total Casualties by Road surface

*	Relation between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night

# STAKEHOLDERS

# Expected Outcomes:

* Identification of high-risk areas and conditions associated with increased accident likelihood.

* Predictive models capable of assessing accident risk based on various factors.

* Actionable recommendations for policymakers and traffic management authorities to implement targeted interventions.

* Enhanced public awareness through accessible visualizations and reports.
